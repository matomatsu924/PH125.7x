### 1.1. Baseball as a Motiviting Example

#### Baseball Basics

### Key points

- The goal of a baseball game is to score more runs (points) than the
  other team.

- Each team has 9 batters who have an opportunity to hit a ball with a
  bat in a predetermined order. 

- Each time a batter has an opportunity to bat, we call it a plate
  appearance (PA).

- The PA ends with a binary outcome: the batter either makes an out
  (failure) and returns to the bench or the batter doesn’t (success) and
  can run around the bases, and potentially score a run (reach all 4
  bases).

- We are simplifying a bit, but there are five ways a batter can succeed
  (not make an out):

1.  <div>

    1.  **Base on balls (BB):** the pitcher fails to throw the ball
        through a predefined area considered to be hittable (the strike
        zone), so the batter is permitted to go to first base.

    2.  **Single:** the batter hits the ball and gets to first base.

    3.  **Double (2B):** the batter hits the ball and gets to second
        base.

    4.  **Triple (3B):** the batter hits the ball and gets to third
        base.

    5.  **Home Run (HR):** the batter hits the ball and goes all the way
        home and scores a run.

    </div>

- Historically, the batting average has been considered the most
  important offensive statistic. To define this average, we define a
  hit (H) and an at bat (AB). Singles, doubles, triples, and home runs
  are hits. The fifth way to be successful, a walk (BB), is not a hit.
  An AB is the number of times you either get a hit or make an out; BBs
  are excluded. The batting average is simply H/AB and is considered the
  main measure of a success rate.

- Note: The video states that if you hit AFTER someone who hits many
  home runs, you will score many runs, while the textbook states that if
  you hit BEFORE someone who hits many home runs, you will score many
  runs. The textbook wording is accurate.

### 1.2. Correlation

#### Correlation

### Key points

- <div>

  - Galton tried to predict sons’ heights based on fathers’ heights.

  - The mean and standard errors are insufficient for describing an
    important characteristic of the data: the trend that the taller the
    father, the taller the son.

  - The correlation coefficient is an informative summary of how two
    variables move together that can be used to predict one variable
    using the other.

  </div>
